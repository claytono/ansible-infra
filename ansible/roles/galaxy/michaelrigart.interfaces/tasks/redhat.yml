# CentOS 8 cloud images ship with ifcfg files for ens3 and eth0. ifcfg-ens3
# seems to be a relic from the image build process, and causes the network
# service to fail. ifcfg-eth0 is useful for most virtual machines, but if a
# cloud image is deployed on bare metal and eth0 is absent, the network service
# will fail. Remove these files if the interface does not exist or is not being
# configured.
